# Nue 1.0 beta - first look

I’m Alan Hemmings, I am NOT an user experience developer from Berlin. I DO NOT build websites that are exceptionally well designed — inside, and outside; life is too short. I do other things, and expect the javascript UX library I use (together with it's default design system template) to do that for me.

## Parting thoughts

This is definitely still a very beta project. There are stability issues preventing me from using it for anything serious. That being said, I think it's very very close and I estimate I'll be using it in production very soon! I love where the project is going and want to be part of the journey. I will be able to judge when it feels stable enough to use on some of my more serious projects for which Nue is going to be perfect.

I can't wait to see how Nue [progresses on it's roadmap][roadmap] and to get my hands on the first set of starter design templates that I can use (as a non designer) without having to constantly tweak CSS. (Default css and design system that works out of the box for tabs, and code formatting supporting light and dark themes et al) it's going to be amazing. I can't wait.

Not being a designer myself, I have to wait for one of the templates to be able to go crazy with grids. While I can use DIVs and css Flex etc to build a grid, it's the sheer simplicity of being able to cleanly create content in a grid that I'm really excited about. Small things with really big impacts.
