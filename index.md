# Nue 1.0 beta

I’m Alan Hemmings, I am NOT an user experience developer from Berlin. I DO NOT build websites that are exceptionally well designed — inside, and outside. I do other things, and expect the javascript UX library I use (together with it's default design system template) to do that for me.

## Nue 1.0 beta notes & impressions

## Parting thoughts

I can't wait to see how Nue [progresses on it's roadmap][roadmap] and to get my hands on the first set of templates that I can use (as a non designer) without having to constantly tweak CSS. (Default css and design system that works out of the box for tabs, and code formatting supporting light and dark themes et al) it's going to be amazing. I can't wait.
