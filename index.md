# Nue 1.0 beta

I’m Alan Hemmings, I am NOT an user experience developer from Berlin. I DO NOT build websites that are exceptionally well designed — inside, and outside. I do other things, and expect the javascript UX library I use (together with it's default design system template) to do that for me.

## Nue 1.0 beta notes & impressions

Dropping some Nue 1.0 beta review notes and random questions here in a quick markdown page, rather than annoying the dev team with questions; somewhere I can point to some working examples to speed up learning and bur reporting during early beta testing where the scope for improvements is really unlimited; having all my personal thoughts in one place means i can treat it like an unsorted backlog to discuss with the team and pick which items warrant moving to become a more detailed github issue.
