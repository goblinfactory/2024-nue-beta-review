# Nue 1.0 beta evaluation

I’m Alan Hemmings, I am NOT an user experience developer from Berlin. I DO NOT build websites that are exceptionally well designed — inside, and outside; life is too short. I do other things, and expect the javascript UX library I use (together with it's default design system template) to do that for me.

This repo contains a Nuejs website with some thoughts on the first beta release of Nuejs.
