### 1. Glow

Pixel perfect, and idiot proof super simple, and super quick and perfectly neat fenced code block color coding, without which I wouldnt even bother writing this review. Taking screenshots of code ...eurgh, life is too short.

```
// this rocks!
1 + 1 = ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢300‚Ä¢‚Ä¢;
console.log('booyaaah!)
```

### 2. Global and local links

Being able to to configure global `Links` to keep markdown clean. Long urls can really make markdown messy; For example, the entire page for my bugs and issues is just this super clean list. There are other benefits as well but this is just sublime.

  ## Issues and feature requests

  These are some issues I've already raised on github with dev team

  1. [Better error message when markdown extension is mispelled][351]
  1. [Use "snippets" pattern to import test code into docs][350]
  1. [Support inline `&lt;span>` components in markdown][348]

</pre>

### 3. Speed and size

Name says it all. Does what it says on the tin. No fluff.

### 4. Inline CSS

I love how I can toggle to enable or disable inline css; so useful to have it turned off when developing. Especially if I'm working with someone else's CSS and html, and I need to right click an element to see where the css is defined.

```yaml
inline_css: true
```

### 5. Devops

1. BUild and deployment time on Cloudflare is insanely Faaaaaaast! 
2. 11 seconds after I hit enter after typing `git push` and it's deployed. That's `3` seconds for Cloudflare to detect the git change, and 8, yes `eight` seconds, and it's deployed and available world wide on the cloudflare CDN!  üï∫üèºüòá

### 6. MMM - Making Markdown Miraculous!

1. Mmmm ... I love how easily you can create custom markdown extensions using Nue.
2. tbd : with some simple examples.

### 7. Hot reloading

1. Hot reloading didn't used to be such a big thing for me; however, when you're able to work and iterate so incredibly fast, and with the clean seperation of content, means seing the changes in realtime as you edit code, just makes you `that` much more productive. 
2. The sheer simplicity of everything; where everything that can be removed has been removed means everything is that much more stable; really super charges the  hot reloading; compared to a lot more planning and design with bigger react et al systems.

### 8. Devs, community, roadmap and Vision

1. Friendly and fast
2. There's a very ambitious and clear roadmap and a hunger for delivering on those goals
3. Seems like there's a good balance between delivering on the roadmap while also focusing on small issues that impact usability. That's a difficult balance to get right. I think that Nue has nailed that balance and It shows. 

### 9. Nue Project Structure

1. (tbd)


### 10. to be continued ... (work in progress)
