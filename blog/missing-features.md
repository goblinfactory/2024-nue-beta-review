## Missing features?

Just a few things that when using Nue to build even a small test blog felt obviously missing

### 1. \[Breadcrumb\] navigation. 

Even a tiny blog with only one main home page, and several child pages quickly needed a way to navigate back that was closer to where I had clicked than having to move the mouse all the way to top left of browser screen. This is a small distance to travel, but when moving back and forth between index and child pages, this felt obviously missing and the extra pixel distance felt like hard work.

### 2. Search

I needed a really quick way to use the nue docs as a reference, but without a simple place to search, it really slows me down. Just a simple textbox search. I literally forgot how to do include an image, i tried `[! /img/foo.svg]` and it didnt work, so feeling foolish I opened nuejs.org and then had to click through a number of menu items to try to find, "now where was it again", all the time I could hear  [Steven Krug shouting at me][steven] , "DONT MAKE ME THINK!". I eventually found it under Markdown extensions, because I was thinking, "image" isnt an extension, that's a basic block, like air and water.
