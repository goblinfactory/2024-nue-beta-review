## These are not the droids you are looking for...

Nothing to see here; going to drop all my notes in the main index, until I have enough to group comments into their own page. This page here just so that I can test nue and navigation.

## "simple-blog" First Thoughts

When even testing Nue for a less than a day building a fake blog website the following questions or "issues" quickly surface

1. How to group collections of blog posts together in a heirarchy? or even just a few pages related to a single blog post that has links to additional info about the blog post you're writing. e.g. if I had blog post, `fabulous-features.md`, and in there I mention 6 examples, two of which require a whole page to document with code examples, where to put the two examples? Better example is "Documentation improvements" below, that really warrants it's own page.
2. Blog starter needs a router aware breadcrumb.
