### 1. Glow

Pixel perfect, and idiot proof super simple, and super quick and perfectly neat fenced code block color coding, without which I wouldnt even bother writing this review. Taking screenshots of code ...eurgh, life is too short.

```
// this rocks!
1 + 1 = ••300••;
console.log('booyaaah!)
```

### 2. Global and local links

Being able to to configure global `Links` to keep markdown clean. Long urls can really make markdown messy; For example, the entire page for my bugs and issues is just this super clean list. There are other benefits as well but this is just sublime.

  ## Issues and feature requests

  These are some issues I've already raised on github with dev team

  1. [Better error message when markdown extension is mispelled][351]
  1. [Use "snippets" pattern to import test code into docs][350]
  1. [Support inline `&lt;span>` components in markdown][348]

</pre>

### 3. Speed and size

Name says it all. Does what it says on the tin. No fluff.

### 4. Inline CSS

I love how I can toggle to enable or disable inline css; so useful to have it turned off when developing. Especially if I'm working with someone else's CSS and html, and I need to right click an element to see where the css is defined.

```yaml
inline_css: true
```

### 5. Codetabs
