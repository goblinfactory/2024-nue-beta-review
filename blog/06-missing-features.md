## Missing features?

Just a few things that when using Nue to build even a small test blog felt obviously missing

### 1. \[Breadcrumb\] navigation. 

Even a tiny blog with only one main home page, and several child pages quickly needed a way to navigate back that was closer to where I had clicked than having to move the mouse all the way to top left of browser screen. This is a small distance to travel, but when moving back and forth between index and child pages, this felt obviously missing and the extra pixel distance felt like hard work.
